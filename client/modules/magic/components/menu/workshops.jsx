         MagIC has hosted workshops in 2011, 2014 and 2017 at the Scripps Institution of Oceanography in La Jolla, California. The format is generally two days of science talks followed by a few days of hands-on tutorials. During the tutorials we give presentations about uploading data into the MagIC database and installing, using, and contributing to the PmagPy paleomagnetic software suite. There is plenty of time given to one-on-one interaction with the MagIC team for help or to give us suggestions. In 2020 the MagIC in-person workshop was postponed due the SARS-CoV-2 virus outbreak and was replaced by a shortened virtual meeting.<br/>

           The 2020 MagIC workshop was to take place March 16th-18th, 2020 in La Jolla, California at the Scripps Institution of Oceanography. Due to the SARS-CoV-2 virus outbreak the in-person workshop has been postponed into 2021. Instead, a virtual meeting was held with one speaker each day giving a talk about MagIC technology and tools. Those talks were recorded and can be viewed on the MagIC YouTube channel: <a href="https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLirL2unikKCgUkHQ3m8nT29tMCJNBj4kj">2020 MagIC Workshop Tutorials</a>.<br/>
